  This paper establishes a multi-stage robust optimization model for IES with both decision-independent uncertainties (DIUs) and decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs).  Additionally, an improved column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm is proposed to solve the complicated scheduling problem with DDUs.
