   We introduce Memoir, an agent that uniquely leverages world model simulation to retrieve episodic memories written to specific viewpoints. The world model serves dual purposes: it models agent intent through imagination to guide memory retrieval, while also providing memory representations for past experiences. Our work also introduces a comprehensive memory architecture combining observation memory for visual cues and navigation memory for navigation patterns.
