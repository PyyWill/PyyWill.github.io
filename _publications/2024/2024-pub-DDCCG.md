   This work develops an energy-production coscheduling model that explicitly incorporates decision-dependent uncertainties. Subsequently, multiple linearization techniques are proposed, each tailored to address the constraints associated with specific types of DDUs, enabling more efficient computation. Furthermore, a specialized algorithm, inspired by the columnand-constraint generation (C&CG) framework, is designed, along with a theoretical analysis of its convergence and computational complexity.
