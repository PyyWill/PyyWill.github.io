abstract: >-
   Modern discrete manufacturing industrial parks increasingly demand real-time energy and production co-scheduling to minimize operational costs. The inherent complexity and diversity of production lines and equipment introduce significant uncertainties into the manufacturing process. Among these uncertainties, decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs) present unique challenges, as the shape of the uncertainty set is influenced by decisions and cannot be determined prior to solving the model. However, existing research largely neglects the impact of DDUs in discrete manufacturing, and current algorithms addressing such uncertainties are computationally intensive, rendering them unsuitable for real-time industrial applications. To this end, this work develops an energy-production coscheduling model that explicitly incorporates decision-dependent uncertainties. Subsequently, multiple linearization techniques are proposed, each tailored to address the constraints associated with specific types of DDUs, enabling more efficient computation. Furthermore, a specialized algorithm, inspired by the columnand-constraint generation (C&CG) framework, is designed, along with a theoretical analysis of its convergence and computational complexity. The proposed method is validated through simulations on a real-world engine assembly line, demonstrating its capability to significantly reduce production costs while enhancing frequency regulation performance.
