   We propose NeuRO, an end-to-end hybrid training framework that integrates the neural network module with a task-based optimization model, defining a new reinforcement learning paradigm for navigation agents. Additionally, the NeuRO agent can be adapted to various multi-ON tasks by simply modifying the structure of the downstream optimization model.
