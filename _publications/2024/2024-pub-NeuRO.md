abstract: >-
   Decision-making mechanisms in embodied agents have garnered significant interest in multi-object navigation (multi-ON). However, the discrepancies between the criteria used to train networks and the evaluation criteria of the final navigation tasks lead to suboptimal agent performance in multi-ON tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose NeuRO, an end-to-end hybrid training framework that integrates the neural network module with a task-based optimization model, defining a new reinforcement learning paradigm for navigation agents. Additionally, we highlight NeuRO's adaptability. The NeuRO agent can be adapted to various multi-ON tasks by simply modifying the structure of the downstream optimization model. Extensive experiments validate that the NeuRO agent can outperform purely network-based approaches on multiple multi-ON benchmarks.
