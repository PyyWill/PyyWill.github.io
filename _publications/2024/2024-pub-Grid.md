   This work develops a two-stage robust optimization model that incorporates a 3-phase unbalanced power flow model for solving the capacity expansion problem. Furthermore, we integrate a predictive neural network with the optimization model in an end-to-end training framework to handle uncertain variables with provable guarantees. Finally, we validate the proposed framework using real-world power grid data collected from our partner distribution system operators.
